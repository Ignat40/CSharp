### Chapter 7: Debugging and Error Handling
    
    Walk through the process of debugging in Visual Studio, including breakpoints and variable monitoring.
    -> Debugging in Nonebreak(Normal) Mode: 
    
    Explain error handling in C# using try-catch-finally blocks and throw expressions.
    -> 
    1. Use try to enclose the code that might throw an exception.
    2. Use catch to handle specific exceptions or use catch (Exception ex) for a general catch-all.
    3. Optionally use finally for code that must be executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
    -> Throwing expressions
    1. Use throw to raise an exception, and you can also use throw expressions for more concise error handling.
    2. Throw expressions are often used in methods or properties to validate input parameters.
