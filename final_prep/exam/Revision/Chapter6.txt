## Chapter 6: Functions

1. Define and use functions in C#, including return values and parameters.
    -> Functions in C# are a means of providing blocks of code that can be executed at any point in an application.
    They are defined using the void keyword for functions that don't return a value
    or specifying a return type for those that do. Parameters allow passing data to a function, 
    and return values allow the function to provide a result to the calling code.

2. Discuss variable scope, local functions, and struct functions.
    -> Variable Scope: Variable scope refers to the region of code where a variable can be accessed.
    Local variables are declared within a block or method and are only accessible within that scope.

    -> Local Functions: C# supports defining functions inside other functions, known as local functions. 
    They have access to the variables of the containing function.

    -> Struct Functions: Functions can be defined within structs in C#. 
    These functions are called struct methods and operate on an instance of the struct.

3.How does overloading functions work, and what is the role of delegates?
    -> Function Overloading: Overloading functions allows defining multiple functions with the same name
    but different parameter lists. The compiler selects the appropriate function based on the number and types of arguments provided.

    -> Delegates: Delegates in C# are objects that refer to methods, allowing for the creation of method pointers. 
    They are often used to implement callback mechanisms and event handling.
