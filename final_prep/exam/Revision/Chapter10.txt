## Chapter 10: Defining Class Members

1. Walk through the definitions of fields, methods, and properties in a class.
-> Within a class definiton, you provide definition for all members of the class, 
including fields, methods, and proeprties. All members have their own accessibility leves, 
defined in all cases by one of the following words: 
    1. Public: Members are accessible from any code. 
    2. Private: Members are accessible only from code that is part of the class. 
    3. Internal: Members are accessible only from code within the assembly(project) where they are defined
    4. Protected: Members are accessible only from code that is part of either the class or a derived class.

-> Defining Fields: 
    ·Readonly: field can be assigned a value only during constructor execution or by initial assignment
    ·Static: members owned by the class, rather than by object instances
    ·Virtual: method can be overridden
    ·Abstrsact: method must be overridden in nonabstract derived classes
    ·Override: method overrides a base class method 
    ·Extern: method definition is found elsewhere
    ·Sealed: if override is used then seald can be used to specify that no further modifications can be made

-> Defining Properties:
    · Getters & setters add security to the fiedls by Encapsulation.
    They are accessors found within properties.
    1. Get: used to return the property value
    2. Set: used to assign a new value, where "value" refers to the value recieved 
    from the user of the property. 

2. Discuss additional topics related to class members, such as hiding base class methods and partial class definitions.
-> Put simply, you use partial class definitions to split the definition of a class across multiple files.
You can, for example, put the fields, properties, and constructors in one file, and the methods in another.
