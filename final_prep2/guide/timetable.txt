  - Practice common recursion problems such as factorial, Fibonacci series, and tree traversals.
  - Study the stack overflow and performance issues related to recursion.

#### Afternoon:
- **Unit Testing:**
  - Learn the basics of unit testing and why it is important.
  - Get familiar with unit testing frameworks in C# (e.g., MSTest, NUnit, xUnit).
  - Write simple test cases and understand assertions.

#### Evening:
- **Git and GitHub Collaborative Work:**
  - Review basic Git commands (clone, commit, push, pull, branch, merge).
  - Understand branching strategies and how to resolve merge conflicts.
  - Learn about pull requests and code reviews on GitHub.

### Day 2: SOLID Principles, Avalonia UI

#### Morning:
- **SOLID Principles:**
  - Study each of the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
  - Understand examples and violations of each principle.
  - Practice identifying and refactoring code to follow SOLID principles.

#### Afternoon & Evening:
- **Avalonia UI:**
  - Get an overview of Avalonia UI and its uses in cross-platform development.
  - Understand the basic components and architecture of Avalonia applications.
  - Practice building a simple user interface with Avalonia.

### Day 3: Searching and Sorting in C#, Algorithm Efficiency and Performance

#### Morning:
- **Searching and Sorting in C#:**
  - Review common searching algorithms (linear search, binary search).
  - Study sorting algorithms (bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort).
  - Implement and practice these algorithms in C#.

#### Afternoon:
- **Algorithm Efficiency and Performance:**
  - Understand Big O notation and its significance in analyzing algorithm efficiency.
  - Analyze the time and space complexity of different algorithms.
  - Practice solving problems with a focus on optimizing performance.

### Day 4: Stream Processing, Fundamentals of Multithreading in C#

#### Morning:
- **Stream Processing:**
  - Learn the basics of stream processing and its applications.
  - Study examples of stream processing in C# using LINQ and other libraries.
  - Practice processing data streams and handling large datasets.

#### Afternoon & Evening:
- **Fundamentals of Multithreading in C#:**
  - Understand the basics of multithreading and its benefits.
  - Learn how to create and manage threads in C#.
  - Study thread synchronization techniques to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.

### Day 5: Asynchronous Programming and Thread Safety in C#

#### Morning:
- **Asynchronous Programming:**
  - Understand the concept of asynchronous programming and its advantages.
  - Learn about async and await keywords in C#.
  - Practice writing asynchronous code and handling asynchronous operations.

#### Afternoon:
- **Thread Safety in C#:**
  - Study the importance of thread safety and common issues like data races.
  - Learn about locks, mutexes, semaphores, and other synchronization mechanisms.
  - Practice making code thread-safe and understand the trade-offs involved.

#### Evening:
- **Review and Practice:**
  - Go over key concepts and definitions from all topics.
  - Take practice quizzes and tests to reinforce your knowledge.
  - Review any areas where you feel less confident.

### Additional Tips:
- **Active Learning:** Engage actively with the material by solving problems, writing code, and testing your understanding.
- **Breaks and Rest:** Ensure you take regular breaks to avoid burnout and get adequate rest, especially the night before the exam.
- **Practice MCQs:** If possible, find multiple-choice questions related to the topics and practice them to get familiar with the exam format.

Good luck with your exam preparation!
