    PADM -> Practical Applicaiont Dev Modle 

    1. Understanding the problem -> thotough analysis of the problem
        Core Approach: break it down into smaller manageable components
        Key steps:
            • Analyze the Problem
            • Identify requirements
            •Claify and Document

    2. Data Structure and System Design 
        Core Approach: architect the system's structure and
                       and choose suitable data structure.
        Key Steps: 
            • Select Data Structures 
            • Design Architecture
            • Align Design Choices

    3. Core Logic Implementation 
        Core Approach: Employ object-oriented programming (OOP) 
                       principles to ensure the code is structured, modular, and encapsulates functionality effectively.
        Key Steps: 
            • Implement Classes and Methods
            • Apply OOP Principles
            • Ensure Code Quality
        
    4. UI Persistence Layer Development 
        Core Approach: Develop  the  software's  user  interface  (UI)  and  data  persistence  layers
                       to  ensure  they  operate  cohesively,  facilitating  an  efficient  interaction  between  the  system's  input/output processes and its data management functions.
        Key Steps: 
            • Construct the UI
            • Implement Data Persistence
            • Ensure Cohesion

    5. Testing and Debugging 
        Core Approach: encorporate  a  comprehensive  testing  and  debugging  strategy  early  in  the  development process. Utilize automated testing frameworks
                       to conduct thorough evaluations across different levels of the software
        Key Steps: 
            • Implement Unit Tests
            • Debug Systematically 
            • Continuous Testing and Refinement 

    6. Refinement for Understandability and Maintainability 
        Core Approach: Periodically  scrutinize  and  enhance  the  codebase  to  boost  its  readability and maintainability.

        Key Steps: 
            • Evaluate Code Quality 
            • Apply Refactoring Techniques 
            • Enhance Documentation
    
    7. Documentation for Clarity 
        Core Approach: Create  detailed  documentation  that  covers  all  aspects  of  the  software  project, from code comments to high-level system overviews.

        Key Steps:
            • Comment Code 
            • Document Architecute
            • Provide Design Rationale

    8. Iterative Development with Emphasis on Adaptability
        Core Approach: Implement a development process that evolves through short, manageable iterations, each delivering a functional segment of the software. 

        Key Steps: 
            • Plan
            • Develop and Test
            • Review and Adapt
